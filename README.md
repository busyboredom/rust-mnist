Rust-mnist is an MNIST dataset parser written in rust. It is simple and lightweight, not 
unreasonably slow and features some helpful error messages.


See examples/perceptron.rs for a rudamentary demonstration.


You will need to download and extract the dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ before
use.
